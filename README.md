# SS13 remake

Welcome! This is my attempt at creating an SS13 remake using node.js.

## Installing

1. Install node.js 8 or later
2. Clone both `http://github.com/bluespess/bluespess.git` and `http://github.com/bluespess/tgstation-remake.git`
3. Run `setup.bat` in the bluespess repo.
4. Run `setup.bat` in the tgstation-remake repo.

Whenever you update to the latest code, run `setup.bat` again afterwards for the simplest and easiest experience.

## Running

Run `launch.bat` in the tgstation-remake repo. To join the server connect to `localhost:8080` using a web browser.
